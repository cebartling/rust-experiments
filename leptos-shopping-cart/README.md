# Leptos Shopping Cart

## Description

This is a simple shopping cart application that allows users to add products to their cart and view the total price of
the items in their cart. The application is built using Rust and Leptos. The exercise comes
from [reactpractice.dev](https://reactpractice.dev/exercise/build-a-simple-shopping-cart-using-react-query/).

## Features

The app should have a simple layout, with the products available on the left side of the page and the shopping cart on
the right side.

Users should be able to:

- Display a list of products
- Display their shopping cart
- Have the ability to add and remove products to the shopping cart
- Increase or decrease the quantity of the products in the cart
- Calculate and display the total price of their cart
- If no product was added to the shopping cart, the page should say: “You haven’t added anything to your shopping cart
  yet.”
- If the quantity of a product is greater than 3 items, add a 10% discount for that product.
- The list of products can be retrieved from a mock API.
